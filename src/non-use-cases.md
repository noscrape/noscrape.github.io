# NON-Use Cases

While Noscrape provides a powerful tool for obfuscating text and protecting sensitive information, it's essential to understand its limitations and use it judiciously. Here are some scenarios where using Noscrape might not be appropriate:

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) 

Noscrape renders text as obfuscated characters, making it unreadable by search engine crawlers. As a result, content obfuscated with Noscrape may not be indexed by search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. This can negatively impact your website's search engine rankings and visibility.

## Accessibility

Obfuscated text can pose accessibility challenges for users with visual impairments or those using assistive technologies such as screen readers. Screen readers rely on text to provide auditory feedback, and obfuscated text may be unintelligible or completely inaccessible to these users.

## Legal Compliance

Using Noscrape to obfuscate legally required information, such as terms of service, privacy policies, or compliance notices, may violate regulatory requirements or legal obligations. Ensure that obfuscating such information complies with applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.

## User Experience (UX)

Obfuscated text can degrade the user experience, especially when used for essential content such as navigation menus, form labels, or instructional text. Users may find it difficult to understand or interact with obfuscated content, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction.
