# Use-Cases

In an era where artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly integral to our daily lives, it's important to remember that AI thrives on data, and your data is a valuable commodity that shouldn't be given away lightly. Here are some key use-cases for noscrape:

## Anti-Scraping Measures for Websites

Implement noscrape on your website to protect against web scrapers. This can be particularly useful for content that is unique to your site, which you wish to prevent from being copied or used without permission. Examples include:

- Sport results
- Betting results
- Prices (e-commerce)
- Geo-information

## Protecting Sensitive Data

Use noscrape to obfuscate sensitive information such as personal identifiers, financial details, or confidential text in a way that is visually accessible but protected against scraping and automated data extraction tools.

## Reduce Bot Interactions

Once your data is protected by noscrape, it makes no sense for scrapers to target it, thereby reducing the number of bot interactions and lowering associated costs.

## Secure Applications

In applications where data security is paramount, such as in banking or healthcare apps, noscrape can be used to display information in a secure manner. Examples include:

- PIN/TAN numbers
- Bot protection (captcha)
